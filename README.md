Watchface definitions
=====================

This repository contains the face definitions used by the [Watchfaces Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.huwig.watchfaces).
You can use it to create your own watchfaces or change existing ones.
To do this, just place the directory `Watchfaces` onto the SD card, maintaining the directory structure.

Documentation
=============

There is a [Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) on how to design your own watch faces as well as the [API-Reference](docs/api-reference.md) that describes all functions.
